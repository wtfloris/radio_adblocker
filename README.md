Modify `AIRPLAY_TARGETS` in `main.py`:

```
AIRPLAY_TARGETS = {
    "Kitchen": 66.6,
    "Living Room": 100.0,
    "Office": 100.0,
}
```

These are your speaker names (use pyatv manually if you're not sure). The values are the maximum volume, so you can scale the volume depending on your setup (closer or larger speakers might need lower volume, etc.)
